My name is Justine Gallien, a proud mother of six incredible children: Star, Jayden, Javiah, Jekhi, Unique, and Treasure. My family is my greatest joy and inspiration. I’ve been blessed to witness their growth and celebrate their unique personalities every day.

My passion for photography began in 2011 when I purchased my first DSLR camera. In 2016, I achieved certification from the Professional Photographers of America, a testament to my dedication and skill. I’ve been honored to receive awards from esteemed organizations like the Professional Photographers of America (PPA), Professional Photographers of Louisiana (PPLA), Southwest Professional Photographers Association, and Lafayette Photographic Society.

I’ve also contributed to the photography community by serving on the Board of Directors of the Professional Photographers of Louisiana and participating in various committees focused on hospitality, membership, exhibitions, and competitions.

I invite you to join me on this creative journey and let me capture timeless images that will be cherished for generations.
